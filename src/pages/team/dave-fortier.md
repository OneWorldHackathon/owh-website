In 2013, Dave was injured in Boston at the site of the first explosion as he was about to complete his first marathon while running for a friend that was dealing with cancer. He received shrapnel injuries to his leg and has hearing loss/ damage in his left ear. Since the bombings, Dave has completed 13 additional marathons and has plans to complete more.
While in rehab with other marathon survivors during summer and fall of 2013, Dave organized a group called 4.15 Strong that helped others injured in the marathon bombings use different forms of movement (marathon training through yoga and biking) in their healing process. 
In 2018, Dave formed a non-profit called One World Strong Foundation â€“ this organization is dedicated to improving the lives of those impacted by acts of terrorism or extremist events and is international in scope. One World works closely with the US Department of State and US Embassy network, as well as with several foreign governments and community leaders to properly align the short and long-term needs of survivors, families that have lost loved ones, and first responders.
