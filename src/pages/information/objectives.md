The creation of a global community working toward a common goal. The implementation of a strong, unified virtual platform whose message of connectivity and openness contradicts the basic premises of violent extremist and terrorist rhetoric. The promotion of a healthy and active lifestyle, global interconnectivity and resiliency for individuals and communities impacted by trauma. One World Marathon will inspire people to see the benefits of working together as a global community and encourage others to develop similar projects.
