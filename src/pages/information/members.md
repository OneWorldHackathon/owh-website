Teams can have any number of members, and, because the one of the main objectives of the event is to connect people across borders and diverse backgrounds, we will encourage teams that represent multiple continents, countries and cultures. For example, schools and individuals in the Middle East can pair with peers in North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and South America.
